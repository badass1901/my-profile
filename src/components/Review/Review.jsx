In the past month we have been working together and I had the opportunity to grow his skills, and within that month he was able to learn new skills to create a simple web-app from scratch and deliver it to me. Communication in English is good, even if it is worth noting that Shashwat is shy on admitting he did not understand something and you will need to pull it out from him.`,

      He is creative, smart, has excellent communication skills, and is willing to help when you need it. He is the kind of person who does anything for the groupâ€™s benefit.`,
